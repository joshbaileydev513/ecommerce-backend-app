## Description
For this Week 13 Challenge we were tasked with creating a back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Youâ€™ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Installation
For installation instructions please visit my github repo https://github.com/joshbaileydev513/ecommerce-backend-app to clone and review the README provided.

## Usage
In order to use this app you will first need to navigate to the `Develop` folder and open up a terminal. When the terminal is open, run the command `npm i` to install your dependencies. You also need to make sure you install the depencies for mySQL/Sequelize/dotenv/express as well. When those are finished installing, type `npm run seed` into your GitBash terminal which will seed our database. Once that is finished, you will type the command `npm run start` which will start the server and open up our localhost on port 3001. You can then open up Insomnia to view your routes for the Tag/Category/Product for GET/POST/PUT/DELETE.
